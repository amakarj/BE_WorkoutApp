## Description

App is designed to keep track of workouts and personal measurements. It focuses primarily on training done with weights or own body weight,
which consists of series, repeats and weights or duration. The app is easy and simple to use and doesn’t take time from the actual workout.
The user can browse their previous measurements and workout sessions and see their progress. The app is targeted for goal-oriented trainers regardless of gender or age,
but for now the app doesn’t serve all sports, for example running, swimming, etc.
